<!--A Paragraph About Alan Hernandez "Hey, that's me!"-->
			<p>
			Hello, my name is Alan and this is my 2nd year as a student at Cerritos College. I am currently working to obtain my certificate in client-side web development.<br />
			On my journey to obtain my certification, I have learned about Python, C++, as well as some other basics of Web development. However, when it comes to HTML and CSS,<br />
			I only have a little bit of experience from high school. But despite my limited knowledge of HTML, I do understand how to modify website text using the inspect element feature.<br />
			One thing I enjoy doing with my coding skills, is making my own video game prototypes (in my free time).
